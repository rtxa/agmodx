AG Mod X is an improved Mini AG alternative made as a plugin for AMX Mod X from the ground. It's easy to add new stuff, make improvements, do changes, etc.

### ☰ Features

- Bugfixed HL inside. Fixes a lot of issues from the original HL and comes with some nice features and improvements.
- Multi-language support (English and Spanish are included).
- Portability/Flexibility. The mod allows to use other plugins in your server and more because the mod itself is an AMXX plugin. You can easily turn it off in case there's an interference with another plugin.
- New gamemodes like **LLHL** or missing ones like **CTF** have been added.
- It's open-source.

### ☰ Improvements and fixes to the original Mini AG.

- Color codes are now displayed and don't get removed anymore (Always enabled).
- Weapons are now displayed in spectator mode.
- Respawn time is now consistent with all FPS values (no more players spawning instantly by using high FPS).
- No more bug of standing corpses from clients playing with high FPS.
- Fixed the chat anti-flood not unmuting you when the game was paused.
- *HUD messages and votes* are now displayed with the *AG Style.*
- CMDs like `agallow`, `agkick` or `agforcespectator` now allow to type the player's name partially and without the need to add color codes.
- New votes have been added: `ag_spectalk`, `mp_respawn_fix` and more.
- Fixed some **damage** cvars not working, like the ones from the *crossbow* and the *hand grenade*. Added damage cvar for gauss secondary attack.
- Help commands like `aglistvotes` and `help` have been improved to display in different pages. Avoids too the chance to get disconnect by overflow when there are a lot of commands.

 More info about the new commands and features can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/rtxa/agmodx/wiki).
