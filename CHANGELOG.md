# Changelog

## [2.6.2] - 2024-10-21

### New

- Added `callvote` command as an alias for `vote`.
- Added `sv_ag_disabled_votes` CVar, which sets what votes are disabled on the server. For example: `sv_ag_disabled_votes "agstart;agabort"` will disable `agstart` and `agabort`.

### Improved

- Now game modes can be disabled on the fly when using `sv_ag_allowed_gamemodes` (no need to wait for map restart).
- Now `mp_respawn_fix` is enabled by default in `startup_server.cfg`. No reason to keep this fix disabled which improves fairness. 
  - If you need to adjust the respawn time, use `mp_respawn_delay`, which is set to 0.95. This is the fastest spawn time at 125 FPS with the old behavior.
  
### Fixed

- Fixed `agnextmode` not working as expected:
  - Don't allow voting with an empty argument or modes that don't exist.
  - It will no longer change the map when accepted or called as an admin, which defeated the purpose of setting a next map for the server.
  - Fixed some misspellings in the translations.

## [2.6.1] - 2024-09-24

### Fixed

- **CTF:** Added missing sound voice when flag returns on its own.
- **CTF:** Fixed flag returning on its own even if player has already returned it.
- Fixed server always restarting in TDM2 mode, regardless of how `sv_ag_gamemode` has been set on `startup_server.cfg`.
- Fixed `server.cfg` not being executed on map change by default. This fixes password not being removed on map change.
  - This can be disabled by removing the line `mapchangecfgfile server.cfg` from `startup_server.cfg`.
- Fixed players outside of the match not being shown as spectators on server pause.
  
## [2.6] - 2024-09-01

### New

  - Now in order to capture, your team's flag must still be at your base.
  - Messages, sounds and the flag model are now like AG.

### Fixed

- Fixed gauss charge sound not being reset when far away (Only on PAS). Still requires fixing on underwater, static discharge, etc.

- **Instagib:** Now self gauss damage is fully blocked.
- Fixed vote not displaying the correct error when the input value is out of bounds.

### Removed

- Removed **Beta** tag from the version. It was used at the beginning of the project when it was far from completion, but now there's no more reason to keep it.
